# Introduction

The libcassvalue library provides a single class and support functions
which allow conversion/storage of a piece of data. It is somewhat reminiscient
of Qt's QVariant. All data is stored in a QByteArray, but there are various
conversion funtions which allow one to convert from QByteArray to different types
(e.g. int32_t, uint64_t, QString, etc.).

You can find additional information about the project, which is connected to
